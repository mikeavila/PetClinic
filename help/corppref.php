<br>
The available colors you can use are listed at the top of the web page. The Background Colors in use for the web page categories 
below it. You can enter the name of any of the displayed available colors into the web category input boxes.
<br><br>
<b><u>Please Note:</u></b> Be sure to enter the filenames just as they are listed using capital letters where indicated. On Linux
systems filenames are case sensitive.
<br><br>
Is there a color that you want to use that is not listed? You can create your own color backgrounds. Just create a PNG file
that is width=1890 and height=1920. Name the file bg.xxxxxx.png. The x's are to be replaced by the name of the color. Then put the 
PNG file in the pictures subdirectory of the vetclinic directory.
<br><br>
A maximum of 11 colors will be displayed. However, if you know the name of a color file and capitalize correctly, it will work
as intended.
